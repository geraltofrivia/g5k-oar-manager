# g5k-oar-manager
I'll be trying to work nicely with OAR resource manager (used on Grid5000) to programatically launch jobs (ML sweeps, primarily). There's going to be an OAR class. I will probably try and deal with multithreading, and maybe also have a interpreter within. Use it at your own risk. It's probably not a wise idea for anyone but me to use it.
